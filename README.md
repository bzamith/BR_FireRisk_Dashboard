## Data
We employ 4 different data sources:

### 1) INMET's Climate Data
INMET, Brazil's National Institute of Meteorology (from Portuguese: *Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia*), provides daily climate data from various meteorological stations across the country.

The data used in this project was extracted from their [official website](https://portal.inmet.gov.br/dadoshistoricos) and covers the period from January 2001 to August 2024.

### 2) INPE's Fire Spot Data
INPE, Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (from Portuguese: *Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais*), provides daily and monthly hotspot detection data based on satellite images.

The data used in this project was extracted from their official website: [daily](https://dataserver-coids.inpe.br/queimadas/queimadas/focos/csv/mensal/Brasil/) and [monthly](https://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/queimadas/situacao-atual/estatisticas/estatisticas_estados/), covering the period from January 2023 to August 2024.

### 3) Ministry of the Environment
Brazil's Ministry of the Environment provides data on monthly financial investments in various environmental initiatives.
